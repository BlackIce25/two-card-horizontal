## Documentation for Business Card
When creating my business card I automatically decided that I wanted to use the project to bring attention to the stickers that I create. One of my favorite stickers was a mushroom man and going along with that I decided to choose an immesive fairy woods feeling for my card. That's why I chose forest green and a beige wood type color. I used figma to put everything together. Sadly due to time I wasn't able to do everything I wanted to do. The background of the page was an image of mushrooms that I took. I felt as though it was perfect for the vibe> I decided to add my linked in and school email. I also chose Kavoon font and Mirza. Which I feel as though gave off the perfect feeling. It ended up being my best first web type project and I love it. test
